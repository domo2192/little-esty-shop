- Utilize advanced routing techniques including namespacing to organize and group like functionality together.
- Utilize advanced active record techniques to perform complex database queries
- Practice consuming a public API while utilizing POROs as a way to apply OOP principles to organize code
### Built With

* [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org)
* [HTML](https://html.com)
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com) _okay only a little_
